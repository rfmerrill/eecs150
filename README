Not all of the code in this repository is mine, as some of it was provided to us in the Skeleton,
and some of it was written by my partner. For examples of code that're almost entirely mine check out
hardware/src/GraphicsProcessor.v software/src/GraphicalApplication/Application.c and
software/src/GraphicalApplication/ISR/isr.s

I'll try to put up an explanation of what's going on here soon.

Apologies for the relative lack of comments. We weren't graded on them and we were pressed for time
so I put off adding them and never got around to it.
